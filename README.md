# Flappy Bird Game in ScalaFX

Welcome to my **Flappy Bird Game** project, developed using ScalaFX as part of my Object-Oriented Programming coursework. This project showcases the application of core OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and composition to build an engaging and interactive gaming experience. 

The game simulates the popular Flappy Bird mechanics, where players control a bird navigating through obstacles. The key features include:

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Players use keyboard input to control the bird, avoiding pipes that spawn dynamically.
- **Game State Management**: Seamless handling of game states such as start, in-progress, win, or game over.
- **Interactive UI**: A visually engaging start page and in-game environment, crafted using layers for background, UI components, and game objects.
- **Collision Detection**: Refined algorithms ensure accurate collision handling between the bird and obstacles.

The project emphasizes reusable and modular code, leveraging traits and inheritance for shared properties (e.g., a `Sprite` trait for drawable objects). Encapsulation keeps game components maintainable, while the use of layouts like `VBox` and `StackPane` enhances the user interface's aesthetics.

This assignment challenged me to tackle issues such as precise collision detection and efficient UI integration. Through iterative problem-solving, I achieved a balanced, functional, and expandable game framework.
